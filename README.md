# Team-Happiness

Our group is collaborating by testing out different programs and tools to compare the suicide rates of countries in correlation to the  World Happiness Report Dataset "Hapiiness Score".  Does socioeconomic status, familial standing, government oversight, age and/or happiness score of a country impact that country's suicide rate? 

What visual data representations would best show the results?

## Is there a correlation between a country’s happiness score and suicide rate?

To examine the correlation between happiness score index and suicide rate, we created three graphs to hopefully provide insight into this question. The first two were bar graphs divided by top and bottom 10 countries, based on happiness score index. The third was a scatter plot depicting all of the represented countries. Unfortunately, with limiting ourselves to using reputable data, we were not able to find a correlation based on the factors provided to determine a country's overall happiness score and suicide rate. 

## Are certain geographical regions happier than others?

Our map assigned a color value to the numerical value of the country's "Happiness Score".  Geography does not appear to be a factor in a happiness score.  The Americas seem to rank higher than other continents as a whole, but there are entire countries that were missing data, so we cannot be entirely sure it's a truthful data representation.  (Africa has several countries not reporting data, therefore it had more 'white' on the map instead of 'blue'.  Was data collected from these countries?  If not, would this have darkened the African map?)

## Do familial status and age have any contributing factors to happiness scores?

We were not able to determine what the familial status indicated.  Did it mean they had family?  That they lived together as a family?  Without knowing specifically what the data was representing, we were frustrated to learn we weren't going to be able to present the data in an understandable way. 

## Any other factors that might correlate to a country’s overall happiness score?

If we had more time, we would have liked to have found something that would indicate what caused a country to be ranked higher.  We realized that without knowing what questions were asked in order to produce this data, we weren't able to use it to storytell as much as we had originally planned and hoped to be able to.

### In Conclusion:

We were not able to find a correlation between a country's happiness score index and suicide rate in 2016.  Further, we were limited in how we set about to present this data as we didn't have access to the original data's source questions. However, we did find a correlation between region of the world and happiness score index. Through the constructed cartogram, it appears that the Western Hemisphere, specifically the America's, had higher scores. Unfortunately, without having access to know fully what the data was asking/polling, we couldn't intrepret it fully.
