# Team-Happiness

Our group is collaborating by testing out different programs and tools by comparing the suicide rates of countries in correlation to the  World Happiness Report Dataset.  Does socioeconomic status, age and/or happiness score of a country impact that country's suicide rate.

> Use Pandas to clean and format your datasets.

> Create a Jupyter Notebook describing the data exploration and cleanup process.

> Create a Jupyer Notebook illustrating the final data analysis.

> Use Matplotlib to create a total of 6-8 visualizations of your data (ideally, at least 2 per "question" you ask of your data).

> Save PNG images of your visualizations to distribute to the class and instructional team, and for inclusion in your presentation.

> (Optional) Use at least one API, if you can find API witj data pertinent to your primary research questions.

> Create a write-up summarizing your major findings.  This should include a heading for each "question" you asked of your data and a short description of your findings and any relevant plots.


Presentation Requirements: 
- Questions you found interesting and what motivated you to answer them
- Where and how you found the data you used to answer these questions
- The data exploration and cleanup process (accompanieed by your Jupyter Notebook)
- The analysis process (accompanied by your Jupyter Notebook)
- Your conclusions, which should include a numerical summary and visualizations of that summary
- The implications of your findings: what do your findings mean?
